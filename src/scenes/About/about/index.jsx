                SGNL are a research grouped based at University College London (UCL). Our focus ranges from individual RSO, constellation analysis and environmental level prediction and democratisation.
                This can range from determining the motion of a tectonic plate, to helping a blind pedestrian navigate across a city, or to predicting the trajectory of a space vehicle thousands of kilometres above the surface of the earth moving at several kilometres per second.

                Our methods include developing new hardware, exploiting GNSS signals (Global Navigation Satellite System) in novel ways and mathematical modelling of forces on space vehicles induced by the space environment. We design and conduct experiments. We simulate complex systems operating in space. We have several distinctive, niche capabilities that have led to successful long-term research relationships with NASA, the European Space Agency, the Ordnance Survey and the UK Hydrographic Office.

                Key projects include intelligent positioning for cities using 3D city models, designing a navigation system for Mars for the European Space Agency, novel navigation systems for ambulances using multiple environment sensors, and orbit determination models (used as operational standards) for the principal missions used by NASA to measure sea level change from space. We like to think we embrace UCLâ€™s values by doing impactful work that benefits many, many people.

                                Marek Ziebart is Professor of Space Geodesy at University College London. His primary area of expertise is the modelling of photon forces on space vehicles. Models and principles developed by Ziebart and his group are used as operational standards for several missions by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre, MIT, US Air Force and ESA. He was the principal investigator on an ESA project to design a navigation and communication system for Mars (joint with Bae Systems). He was a member of the NASA-CNES ocean surface topography science working team, and serves on the governing board of the IGS (International GNSS Service).
